# Isaac Point Cloud

## Overview  
Isaac Point Cloud is an open-source project that provides a structured approach to:
- **Capturing point cloud data** in Isaac Sim using Physics LiDAR.
- **Auto-labeling objects** within specific simulation groups.
- **Training a PointNet-based model** for object detection and segmentation.
- **Visualizing** the resulting point clouds and bounding boxes.

This repository serves as a **concept proposal** rather than an actively developed project. Contributions and research from the community are welcome.
