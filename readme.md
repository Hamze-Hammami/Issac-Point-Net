# Isaac Point Net üöÄ

## Overview  
Isaac Point Net is an open-source project that provides a structured approach to 3D pointcloud calssfication and cuboid detection, by capturing data on simulation theough an automated labeling process, with pytorch and on issac sim:

## üîé why on sim ?
The approach aims to shed light on affordable prototyping. 3D LiDARs are extremely expensive, but with this approach, you can create a LiDAR object detection model without even purchasing one. 

## üöß Project Limits
1.	While the LabelImg process is much easier, it only works on static scenes.
2.	The labeling task takes more time when more instances are present.
3.	No class implementation at the moment, only instances.

## Features üèÜ

1- Physics LiDAR-Based Point Cloud Capture ( through ISSAC ) 

2- Auto-Labeling of Simulation Data  

3- Training a PointNet-Based Model  


## Data Formats

### PCD v0.7 Format  
Point cloud files are saved using the PCD v0.7 format. An example header is as follows:

```
.PCD v0.7 - Point Cloud Data file format
FIELDS x y z instance
SIZE 4 4 4 4
TYPE F F F I
COUNT 1 1 1 1
WIDTH N
HEIGHT 1
VIEWPOINT 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
POINTS N
DATA ascii
```

- **x, y, z:** The 3D coordinates for each point.
- **instance:** An integer representing the object instance label (e.g., background is labeled as `0`).

## Pretrained Example weights from Hugging Face ü§ó

### How to Pull the Example Model  
A pretrained PointNet-based model is available on Hugging Face to help jump-start experimentation. You can download it using either of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/ISSAC-PointNet
```

#### Option 2: Download from Hugging Face Model Hub
[Download the Model Here](https://huggingface.co/Hamze-Hammami/ISSAC-PointNet/tree/main/models)

#### Option 3: Install via Hugging Face Hub
```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

Then, download and load the model:
```python
from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download
import torch
from train import PointNetDetector  # Ensure your PointNetDetector is defined as in this repo

# Download the pretrained model from Hugging Face Hub
model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="Hamze-Hammami/ISSAC-PointNet", filename="pointnet_detector.pth")
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Initialize and load the model
model = PointNetDetector().to(device)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path, map_location=device))
model.eval()

```

## auto-Labeling, Training, Testing, and Visualization Scripts


### üìù auto-Labeling PointCloud data through issac 
This script is an experimental implementation for capturing and labeling cones in a simulated Isaac Sim environment. The script utilizes a simulated 3D LiDAR sensor to extract and label point cloud data.

Running via Script Editor (Isaac Sim)
To run the script directly within Isaac Sim, follow these steps:
1. Open **Isaac Sim** and load your scene.
2. Navigate to **Window ‚Üí Script Editor**.
3. open the script scripts/ISSAC_LABEL_PCD.py, Copy and paste the script into the editor and run it 
4. Click **Run** to execute the script.

currently script captures static scenes, finding a way to capture live scenes would speed up operations


### üèãÔ∏è Training the PointNet Model
The training script can be used to Train a PointNet-based model on labeled point cloud data. The current setup has been tested on a limited dataset of five PCD files.

Run the training script with:
```bash
python scripts/train.py
```

### üß™ Testing the Model on a Labeled PCD File
To evaluate the trained model and compare the predicted cuboids with the actual labeled cuboids, run:
```bash
python scripts/test.py
```


### üé® Visualizing Point Cloud Data
An experimental script for visualizing labeled point cloud data is provided. This script supports toggling between predicted, merged, and corrected bounding boxes:
```bash
python scripts/visualise_pcd.py
```
